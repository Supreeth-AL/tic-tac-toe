In this project, I developed a simple yet engaging Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python, demonstrating core programming concepts such as control flow, loops, functions, and data structures. The game allows two players to compete in a classic 3x3 grid setup, taking turns to place their symbols (X or O) on the board. It efficiently checks for win conditions after each move, ensuring that the game concludes with a winner or a tie.
